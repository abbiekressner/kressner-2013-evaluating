Please note that I did not necessarily use all of the files and functions
provided while preparing the above paper.  I have just given access to the
files as they existed on my computer, with the exception that I have removed
functions and files that are not my own and deleted irrelevant code.

You will need to install the files at https://github.com/abbiekre/MatlabTools
as well.

--- 
See notes/hasqi028.txt for details on how I ran the data through the model.
See notes/hasqi034.m and notes/hasqi037.m for details on the analysis and
plotting.

Since I do not have permission to pass along the code and data I obtained from
other researchers, I have left out the following:
(1) the code for computing the benchmarking objective measures (obtained from
Philip Loizou)
(2) the code for HASQI (obtained from James Kates)
	KatesModel.patch summarizes changes I made to Kates's code
(3) the code for the Carney/Bruce model (obtained from Ian Bruce)
(4) the speech files and corresponding subjective ratings (obtained from Yi Hu)
