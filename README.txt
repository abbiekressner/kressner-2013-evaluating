A.A. Kressner, D.V. Anderson, and C.J. Rozell. Evaluating the generalization of
the Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI). IEEE Transactions in Audio,
Speech and Language Processing, 2012.

Since I do not have permission to share the code and data I obtained from
other researchers, this repository does NOT contain the following:
(1) the code for computing the benchmarking objective measures (obtained from
Philip Loizou)
(2) the code for HASQI (obtained from James Kates)
	Note: KatesModel.patch summarizes changes I made to Kates's code
(3) the code for the Carney/Bruce model (obtained from Ian Bruce)
(4) the speech files and corresponding subjective ratings (obtained from Yi Hu)

You will need to install the MATLAB files at https://github.com/abbiekre/MatlabTools
as well.

See notes/hasqi028.txt for details on how I ran the data through the model.
See notes/hasqi034.m and notes/hasqi037.m for details on the analysis and
plotting.
