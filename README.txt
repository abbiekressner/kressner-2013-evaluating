the Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI). IEEE Transactions in Audio,
Speech and Language Processing, 2012.

Please note that I don't necessarily use all of the files and functions provided.  I
have just give access to the files as they existed on my computer when I was
preparing the above paper, with the exception that I have removed functions and
files that were obtained through other researchers.  Read notes below for the
details.

--- 
See notes/hasqi028.txt for details on how I ran the data through the model.  See
notes/hasqi034.m and notes/hasqi037.m for details on the analysis and plotting.

Since I do not have permission to pass along code and data I obtained from
other people, I have left out the following: (1) the code for computing the
benchmarking objective measures was obtained from Philip Loizou, (2) the code for
running HASQI was obtained from James Kates (KatesModel.patch summarizes
changes I made to the code), (3) the code for the Carney/Bruce model was obtained
from Ian Bruce, (4) the speech files and corresponding subjective ratings were
obtained from Yi Hu.

Note to self: The ai files are inside the figures folder in the (separate)
journal_2011hasqi repository.
