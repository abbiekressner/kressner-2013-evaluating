Started Friday around 7pm (9/9). Finished around 02:45 on Sunday (9/11).  Let's
say it took about 31.75 hours. (Restarted computer before getting printed text
to the  matlab command window.)

Note that I initially forgot to include the clean wav files since they were
within a clean folder in ~/sym/Dynastat on akressner (whereas they are not
nested in a folder on cortex where I ran this code last time).
